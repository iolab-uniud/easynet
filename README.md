The [EasyNet project](https://easy-net.info) (in Italian) aims at improving healthcare practice and equity in various clinical and organizational settings  effectiveness by means of Audit & Feedback (A&F) strategies.

This repository contains the code and (anonymized) data used in the WP2 of the project. Specifically, it addresses the A&F of Emergency Medicine.
